# Food-Forecasting-

Demand forecasting is a key component to every growing online business. Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand.

Too much inventory in the warehouse means more risk of wastage, and not enough could lead to out-of-stocks â€” and push customers to seek solutions from your competitors.

In this project, it is analysed which cuisine is most favored from mulitple aspects.
